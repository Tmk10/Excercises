"""The Fibonacci Sequence is computed based on the following formula:
f(n)=0 if n=0
f(n)=1 if n=1
f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2) if n>1

Please write a program to compute the value of f(n) with a given n input by console.

Example:
If the following n is given as input to the program:

7

Then, the output of the program should be:

13"""
